# tiny
Tiny is a repo that demonstrates how to create and manage a simple python project. It contains four python files that print or define simple functions, and an empty file for testing purposes.

The python files are:

- `src/foo.py`: A python file with a comment
- `src/hello.py`: A python file that prints "Hello, world!"
- `src/goodbye.py`: A python file that prints "Goodbye, world!"
- `src/inner/bar.py`: Another python file with a comment
- `src/inner/baz.py`: A python file that defines a function `baz` that prints "Baz!"
- `src/one.py`: A python file that defines a function `one` that prints "One!"

The C file `src/test.c` was deleted because it was irrelevant to the repo's theme. It was a program that checked if a number was prime or not, which has nothing to do with python or simple functions.

The main features and benefits of this repo are:

- It shows how to organize python files in a `src` directory
- It shows how to use comments and docstrings to document python code
- It shows how to print messages and define functions in python
- It shows how to use git to track changes and create pull requests
