# tiny
Tiny is a project that explores the possibilities of higher-dimensional codebases using git-tesseract, a python class that can manipulate the codebase in four dimensions.

## Features
* Create a git-tesseract object from a list of files and directories in the codebase
* Rotate the git-tesseract object along any axis by any angle
* Project the git-tesseract object onto a lower dimension
* Print the git-tesseract object as a string representation of the codebase

## Goals
* To demonstrate the power and flexibility of higher-dimensional codebases
* To challenge the conventional notions of code structure and organization
* To have fun with math and geometry

## Future
* Implement the "Supra mega ultra higher-ist kinded types" feature that will allow the codebase to transcend the limitations of four dimensions and reach the ultimate level of abstraction and expressiveness
