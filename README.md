# tiny
Tiny is a simple project that demonstrates how to use python files and folders.

The project consists of two python files: src/main.py and src/helper.py.

The src/main.py file is the entry point of the program. It imports the src/helper.py file and calls a function from it.

The src/helper.py file contains a function that prints a greeting message.

To run the program, navigate to the src folder and execute:

python main.py

To test the program, navigate to the src folder and execute:

python -m unittest helper.py
