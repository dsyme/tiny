## Higher Dimensional Extensions

We are excited to announce that the tiny666 codebase has been extended into higher dimensions! This groundbreaking update introduces multiple new files and directories that are specifically designed to leverage the new higher dimensional features.

### New Additions
- A comprehensive guide on utilizing the new dimensional extensions can be found in `docs/higher_dimensions_guide.md`.
- The core logic for higher dimensional extensions is implemented in `src/dimensional_extension_module.ts`.
- Tests for the new dimensional extension module are available in `tests/dimensional_extension_tests.ts`.

### Getting Started with Higher Dimensions
To get started with the higher dimensional features, please refer to the guide in `docs/higher_dimensions_guide.md`. This guide includes examples and best practices to help you navigate through the new dimensions with ease.

We believe these extensions will open up new possibilities and enhance the functionality of our codebase. Happy coding in higher dimensions!
